# Introduction

The purpose of this book is to teach you how to write Lua code that
runs fast with RaptorJIT.

To write fast code we need to understand how the compiler works.

We will look at the compiler in three different ways:

1. Descriptively: Which blocks of code are compiled as a unit? How do the pieces fit together? How are they optimized?
2. Operationally: How does compilation happen? 
3. Empirically: How do we review how a program actually ran? How do we evaluate whether it ran well? How do we make improvements?

Once we know the answers to these questions we will be able to write code that is easy to optimize.
